3 Effects of a soft cut-off in Twitter OSN
4 Modeling OSNs as evolving bipartite networks
5 Spammers' linking strategies and Link farming in Twitter
6 Inferring topics for Twitter users


1 Introduction

* background - popularity of OSNs in today's Web, generation of huge web traffic, 

used not only to connect to friends and people with similar interests, but also as an information / resource sharing medium - 
discover recent news and people's opinion among them, discover popular vidoes; 
a specific type of online social systems, folksonomies, are meant primarily for resource sharing, but social networks such as Facebook and Twitter are also increasingly being used for sharing and searcing for information / resources. 
in fact, popular OSNs such as Facebook and Twitter have almost become a Web within the Web.


* Features of Online social networks

- Network structure

modeling of social networks as complex networks (brief description of complex networks)
- most commonly represented as unipartite networks. Nodes are usually users / accounts and links are social links. can be directed or undirected. Note that for some online systems, nodes can be other things, e.g. videos in Youtube, blogs, etc

- social networks in the human society have been studied since a long time, but OSNs are different in some aspects
topological similarities and differences between social networks in the human society and in the online world - 
both exhibit small world properties
huge size, Dunbar number vs huge number of links, assortativity, 


- users form social groups

based on e.g. common topical interests, or common affiliation.

community detection from the social network has been attempted, but in OSNs, users themselves form related communities - recent paper by Adamic in WSDM

Facebook, Youtube allow users to explicitly form social groups, 
Twitter has no groups feature, but its Lists feature is similar where a user can create a List and group together related users.

- group memberships of users are represented as bipartite networks; projections of these bipartite networks have also been used. - need to find references


- vast amounts of user-generated content
plethora of ugc, e.g. text messages / images in Twitter and Facebook, videos in Youtube.

relationship between users and content (resources) also represented as bipartite networks. projections can be used to find similar resources, for recommendation, etc (Youtube video recommendation paper)

can be used for search, study of information diffusion

there exist OSNs specifically for resource sharing - social tagging sites or folksonomies - represented as tripartite networks, not being detailed

- the OSNs bring new scope as well as new challenges

new scope - relative ease of collecting authentic data regarding interactions etc (instead of user surveys, e.g. Milgram's experiment can actually be repeated by computation on the network data), allow sociology theories to be tested over a huge population, advertising and broadcast of new information can be quick

several new challenges for OSNs, some of which are scalability, spam and malicious usage, utilizing the vast amounts of user generated content
need for new growth models that can explain the evolving structure of OSNs, in view of their differences with social networks in the human society
developing search and recommendation services since the amount of resources and information content has become too large for a user to find what is of interest to him, 
need inter-disciplinary approaches involving complex network theory, sociology, search and data mining, etc


* Objectives of the thesis 

we concentrate on Twitter which is one of the two most popular OSNs today. we focus on some of the above challenges
briefly stated here, detailed in chapter 2

(i) use complex network theory as a tool to better understand evolution dynamics in OSNs
(ii) devise methods to improve Twitter search, so as to better utilize Twitter as an information sharing system


* Contributions of the thesis 

(i) growth model for social networks in presence of cutoffs which are being imposed in most popular OSNs
(ii) better growth models for bipartite networks, which can be used to study evolving interactions of users with groups / resources
(iii) detailed study of spammers' link-formation strategies and link farming in Twitter, which will help in preventing spammers from acquiring high influence ranks according to algorithms such as HITS and Pageranks, and hence prevent spam-tweets from appearing in top results in Twitter search
(iv) a novell method to infer attributes of users in Twitter, which has several applications, e.g. searching for topical experts in Twitter, characterizing the information content of the Twitter platform as a whole, etc

these issues have been well-studied in case of the Web, but not for OSNs


* Organization of the thesis



2 Background and Related Work

As mentioned in Introduction, we focus on two challenges - better understanding evolution dynamics in OSNs and improving 
information / resource search in OSNs - with focus on Twitter.

Both challenges have been heavily researched, primarily for systems other than OSNs - 
growth / evolution of large networks studied in the Complex Network Theory community, for social, technological, biological networks.
various aspects of information search studied in context of Web search.

Here we briefly survey related literature on the above areas. for completeness, we survey not only studies on OSNs, but also related studies on network evolution in general and on Web search.


2.1 Evolution dynamics in networks

a large number of network growth models have been proposed in the complex network theory community. 

* evolution of unipartite networks - see Section 2.3.2 of Bivasda thesis, add studies which consider cutoffs

* evolution of bipartite networks

* scope of work:
no prior study on how restrictions affect evolution of OSNs. Also, only hard cutoffs studied, not other forms of cutoffs

need for better growth models for bipartite networks and their projections


2.2 Search in online social forums and the Web

two ways to discover information in OSNs: 
word-of-mouth discovery (what the social contacts / friends have tweeted) - Fabricio's IMC 2011 paper
and search (Teevan paper).

search becoming more and more popular - with the huge amount on users in today's OSNs, it is difficult to know who one should connect to, in order to get information on a topic of interest. so search can be used to find people who are good sources of information on a topic of interest, and then social contacts can be established to those people. 

challenges that are needed to improve search - infer topics of sources of information, develop ranking schemes, prevent spammers from abusing the ranking schemes. All these have been studied for the Web, but brings new challenges in case of OSNs.

[need to refer to papers both on the Web and on OSNs, for the above aspects]

* studies on evolving dynamics in OSNs can help to improve information discovery in OSNs - e.g. bipartite user-resource networks and their projections can be utilized for personalized recommendation of resources to users (collaborative filtering)

* scope of work
existing studies focus on characterizing spammers, or estimating the effect of spam
but research on Web / email spam has reached the next level of identifying the support structures of spam. 
This is yet to be investigated in OSNs. Also, ranking schemes that are robust against link spam need to be devised for OSNs

existing methods attempt to infer topical attributes for users in OSNs from what the users post. Other alternative methods, such as utilizing social annotations (which has shown to produce good results in case of webpages), need to be tried

2.3 The Twitter online social network

- background on Twitter - directed network, nodes are users / accounts. indegree means popularity, outdegree means activity. 
- in many ways, a publish / subscribe system. many properties found distinct from what is expected in social networks, have raised the question whether it is a social network or a social media
- boom in popularity since 2008. estimate of growth, estimate of traffic. 
- problem of spam who aim to capitalize on the popularity of the medium
- restriction imposed to handle scalability and indiscriminate linking by spammers
- has emerged popular platform for discovering news on recent events. search becoming more and more popular.
