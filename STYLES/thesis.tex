\documentclass[twoside,phd]{iitkgp}

% The iitkgp.cls class is for producing theses and dissertations
% in the CSE Department of IITKGP.  You can supply
% the following optional arguments in the square brackets to
% specify the thesis type:
%
%   senior  : Produces the senior thesis preliminary pages (default)
%   phd     : Produces the PhD dissertation preliminary pages
%
% FOR ALL DEPARTMENTS, open the iitkgp.cls file, go to the "Certificate Page" section
% of the main code and make appropriate changes.
%
% FOR DEPARTMENTS other than CSE open the iitkgp.cls file, go to the "Title Page" section
% of the main code and make appropriate changes.
%
% The default format is appropriate for printing, with blank pages
% inserted after the preliminary pages in twoside mode so you can
% send it directly to a two-sided printer. Howev  er, for ETD
% submission the blank pages need to be removed from the final output.
% The following option does this for you:
%
%   etd     : Produces a copy with no blank pages in the preliminary section.
%             Remove this option to produce a version with blank pages inserted
%             for easy double sided printing.
%
% The rest of the class options are the same as the regular book class.
% A few to remember:
%
%   oneside : Produces single sided print layout (recommended for theses less than 50 pages)
%   twoside : Produces single sided print layout (the default if you remove oneside)
%
% The BYUPhys class provides the following macros:
%
%   \makepreliminarypages : Makes the preliminary pages
%   \clearemptydoublepage : same as \cleardoublepage but doesn't put page numbers
%                           on blank intervening pages
%   \singlespace          : switch to single spaced lines
%   \doublespace          : switch to double spaced lines
%
% --------------------------- Load Packages ---------------------------------

% The graphicx package allows the inclusion of figures.  Plain LaTeX and
% pdfLaTeX handle graphics differently. The following code checks which one
% you are compiling with, and switches the graphicx package options accordingly.
